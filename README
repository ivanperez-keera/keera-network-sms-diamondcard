This library allows you to send SMSs using DiamondCard's web interface.
Beware: I will not be held responsible for the problems caused by malfunctions
or similar. Use it at your own risk. This program is not fully tested and I
cannot guarantee that it works as you expect it to. If it wastes all the credit
in your diamondcard account, it won't be my fault.

TODO
====
DiamondCard also provides a SOAP interface. I've been unable to use shoap (a
Haskell library implementing the SOAP standard) for that purpose. As soon as I
figure out a way to make it work, I'll improve this code. At the present time,
you don't get error messages if you run out of money or of the service doesn't
work. You only get notified if the there are problems at the HTTP layer (or
below).

Does that bug you? It bugs me. If you want to fix it, send me an email.
We can figure it out together.
